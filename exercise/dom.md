# DOM
document intypen dan zie je het dom object raamwerk

object inside the DOM can have methods(things that the object can do) and properties (describing the object)

setting a property
getting a proprety 

call method like car.drive();

method is something what an object can do. so that differs from functoions. it has to be associated with an object


*example* 

we can access the properties and methods with the dot.notation

 button

 - properties 
 .innerHTML
 .style
 .firstChild

- methods something what an object can do.
methods has parantheses behind and a function in it.
.click()
.appendChild()
.setAttribute()

querySelector (css selectors)



classList (it's a property for every dom object)
add() is a method


## innerHTML and textContent
with innerHTML you can add HTML styling to it like <em> <strong> <h2>
