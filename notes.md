### switch (if you check one variable switch is a good case otherwise use if  )
switch (text) {
  case condition:
  then do this ...
  break; 
  }
  
} default (if non of the cases is)


switch will check the cases and break out of the switch statement when it finds a match.


### radio buttons
As mentioned, radio buttons come in groups. Use the required name attribute to group together a set of related radio buttons. In the above example, all <input>s share the same value for name, so they are treated as part of the same group. This lets users only choose one option in a group at a time â€” try it out above.


//change event

change event .. fires when the user changed the value. 



## events

browselevel event - load, resize, scroll
dom level events (when we do something in the websitre) - mouse, formbased events and etc.

how to use

-first grab the DomNode 
-tell this domNode what need to happen by giving the -event (click, mouseover and etc);


## prevent default

the event object gives us information about the event that occured. 



e.preventDefault()

prevents the default functioning be happening. 
for instance when you submit a form. the default behavior is going to another page. but if you want to prevent the default behavior. 


vb

 // log(`the button with this value :: `, this.value, ` has been checked`, e);
  // log(e)
  // log(e.target.id);
  // log(e.target.value)
