### switch (if you check one variable switch is a good case otherwise use if  )
switch (text) {
  case condition:
  then do this ...
  break; 
  }
  
} default (if non of the cases is)


switch will check the cases and break out of the switch statement when it finds a match.


### radio buttons
As mentioned, radio buttons come in groups. Use the required name attribute to group together a set of related radio buttons. In the above example, all <input>s share the same value for name, so they are treated as part of the same group. This lets users only choose one option in a group at a time â€” try it out above.


//change event

input event .. fire of when the value of your input get's changed. also works for backspaces and etc. 

change event .. fires when the user changed the value.
